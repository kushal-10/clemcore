    "## The Annotated Hellogame\n",
    "\n",
    "This game uses the example of the `hellogame`, which is part of the `clemgame` distribution (but not the benchmark), to explain how to add a game to the benchmark. This game makes use of all abstract classes, which means that it uses default ways of doing the required things as much as possible. This is not strictly necessary, and if you have good reasons, you can do more \"manually\" (meaning, define code in your game rather than inherit it), but then you have the responsibility to making sure that everything is loaded and logged in the way that the evaluation scripts expect. In any case, it will help getting familiar with the setup to try to understand what's going on here first."

    "Let's recall what we did in the previous notebook to define a dialogue game and to simulate players using language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We designed a number of initial prompts that \"explain\" the game and the role for each given player. In particular, this prompt explained the *move rules* (the format that we expect the player's response to be in), and the *game rules* (what the consequences of a valid move will be, in terms of getting closer to the goal of winning [or not])\n",
    "- We formalised these rules in python code, so that the `GameMaster` can actually check them, and adjudicate whether the game can continue or not.\n",
    "- We set up a simple loop that, in turn, prompted each player with the current state of the game, checked the response, updated the state of the game, and did the same for the next player. And so on, until some condition is met -- e.g., success has been reached, or a maximal number of turns has been produced. Or, of course, something has failed in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook now takes the step from designing this simple loop to doing so in a way that the game can be fit into our benchmark setup. In this setup, we want to be able to define in advance a number of *game instances* (e.g., in a guessing game, targets to guess), and want a single, standardised entry point for running the game, logging the results, and producing game specific scores per episode, that will ultimately enter into the overall benchmark. For this, the `clemgame` framework sets up *a lot* of scaffolding. Here, we'll try to unpack this a little bit.\n",
