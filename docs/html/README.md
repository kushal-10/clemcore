#### API generated with [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/)
The documentation is generated automatically based on the docstrings. 
We decided to use [the Google format](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings), which is supported by pdoc, widely used, and can be set as default in your IDE.

#### To generate the docs, call (from within clembench):

`pdoc -o docs/ --html clemcore`
