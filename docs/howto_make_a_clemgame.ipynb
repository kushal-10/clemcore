    "# Game concept\n",
    "The first step of creating a new clemgame is to come up with a game concept, or to find an existing dialogue game to adapt. In either case, it is important that the rules of the game can be implemented programmatically. While you can implement a clemgame with complex parsing, it is recommended to keep rules simple enough to understand benchmark results without learning code intricacies of the clemgame implementation."

    "Let's implement a simple two-player game we will call `firstlast`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The players should engage in a back-and-forth conversation about a predefined topic. Player A starts with an utterance whose first and last word must start with a predefined letter, say  `d`. Player B must then reply with an utterance whose first and last word must be the next one in the alphabet (here, an `e`). And so on, for `n` rounds (where each round comprises a single turn, with an utterance from A or B). If an utterance does not conform to these rules (i.e. it is incorrect), the players lose the game. We also define a move format rule: If an utterance does not start with `I SAY: ` (i.e., it is invalid), the game is immediately aborted. If all utterances up to turn `n` are valid and correct, the game is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the topic is `birds`, the initial letter is `h` and the number of ~~turns~~ rounds is 2, this would be a successful game:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player A: \"Hi! I love birds, but it's hard to identify them. I need help.\" (h: hi / help)\n",
    "- Player B: \"I know what you mean. I can try to help, please describe it.\" (i: I/ it)\n",
    "- Player A: \"Just a moment... Ok, it's blue but looks like an Eurasian jay.\" (j: just / jay)\n",
    "- Player B: \"Kick in more details, otherwise I don't know.\" (k: kick / know)\n",
    "\n",
    "In each round, we need to check two aspects:\n",
    "- Does the utterance have a valid form fit to be parsed? Failing to meet this leads to the game being aborted. (Move format rule.)\n",
    "- Does the utterance fulfil the game rules for a successful round? Failing to meet this leads to game being lost. (Game rules.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things simple, in this example we will check only these conditions:\n",
    "- Validity: Does the utterance start with `I SAY:`?\n",
    "- Correctness: Do the first and last words begin with the same, correct letter at play?\n"

    "\n",
    "The `instances.json` file contains a JSON object with the single key `experiments`, which holds a list of JSON objects, each corresponding to an experiment. An experiment holds clemgame parameters that apply for all its instances, and is used to evaluate and compare scores between different variants of a clemgame. The keys `name`, to identify different experiments, and `game_instances` are mandatory for all experiment objects.\n",

The clemcore framework provides base classes to organise this.

Then, in the main call, instantiate this class and call its `.generate()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `on_generate` method, we define experiments and then define instances of each experiment. An instance is a configuration of one specific game play and an experiment is a set of related instances. We can define what is an experiment and what is an instance depending on what dimensions we want to evaluate later.\n",

To define an instance in an experiment, we define the initial letter, the initial prompts and the number of turns. This is useful if we wish to evaluate the performance of LLMs on variations of the same topic. Another possibility would be to define experiment as a set of instances with the same number of turns, and then each instance could be about different topics. That's our choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this will automatically create a `JSON` file with a key `experiments`, which is a list of experiments. Each element has a name and a list of `game_instances`. A game instance should have at least a `game_id` assigning an index to that instance and other keys and values that are necessary to play the game. Here, the initial prompts can have their slots already filled with the instance's values (or we can leave that for the `setup` method of the game master).\n",

The only method that we must implement is `_custom_response()`, which must define a programmatic behaviour for this player.

    "# GameMaster implementation\n",
    "The core clemgame functionality is implemented in its game master class, containing the play loop and handling any game-specific interaction. While a game master can be fully custom and based on just the minimal implementation in the clemcore `GameMaster` base class, the more extensive `DialogueGameMaster` base class inheriting from `GameMAster` is commonly used. `DialogueGameMaster` implements the game conversation loop described in the clembench papers, and only requires extension for game-specific behavior. The game master must be implemented in `master.py`, located in the root directory of a clemgame.\n",
    "## Defining the GameMaster class\n",
    "Open `master.py` in the `firstlast` directory. Remove the `class SomeGamePlayer(Player)` definition (for your own clemgame, you can rename this class and add it to it if your player class does not need much extra code).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need define the game master, a class that inherits from `DialogueGameMaster` and implement certain required methods, mainly its `_on_setup()` method and play loop methods like `_does_game_proceed()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics that every game must compute are listed at `clemcore/clemgame/metrics.py`, described in [log events and build records](logging_and_scoring.md) and in more detail in the paper's appendix. Note: You should **not** implement `METRIC_PLAYED` if you use the provided evaluation scripts, because this metric is inferred from `METRIC_ABORTED` there. Besides, any number of additional game-specific metrics can also be logged (see more below).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the mandatory methods. However, for readability, we will also write auxiliary methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: The game master has to log ***every event*** that is relevant to reconstruct the interaction, build the transcript and evaluate the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DialogueGameMaster` is also a `GameResourceLocator`, which has special methods to access and write files in the game's local directory, and a `GameRecorder`, which knows how to log events. We'll see below how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GameMaster` and `DialogueGameMaster` base classes have a `GameResourceLocator` to access resources and a `GameRecorder` to be used by all involved class objects.\n",
    "### Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to initialise the game master. The `__init__` method gets the experiment object and a list of `Model` objects (`Model` objects are given by the benchmark scripts and handled by clemcore backends).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rename the `DialogueGameMaster` child class in `master.py` to `FirstLast`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the docstring of the class to fit the game: `\"\"\"Implement mechanisms for playing FirstLast.\"\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning of `master.py` should now look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os.path\n",
    "from typing import Dict, Tuple, List, Union\n",

    "### Keeping records\n",
    "`DialogueGameMaster` handles all default record keeping, but game-specific records need to be implemented using the `log_key()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: see details about keeping records in [log events and build records](logging_and_scoring.md).\n",
    "#### Default record keeping\n",
    "All events that occur during the game, i.e. all actions by the game master and by the players, must be documented. This is done by the methods of `GameRecorder` of the `GameMaster`. The essential ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the beginning of every turn, call `log_next_turn()` (a turn is one player response and its processing by the game master). This is already implemented in the `DialogueGameMaster` base class play loop.\n",
    "- In the game setup, call `log_players()` in order to log the models that are playing this episode of the game. This is already implemented in the `DialogueGameMaster` base class setup.\n",
    "- Use `log_event()` to log all types of actions with a `to` and `from_`.\n",
    "- The `action` object passed to `log_event()` must contain at least a key `type` and a key `content`. The first can be `send message`, `get message`, `metadata`, `parse`, `error`, `invalid format` or any game-specific types. Content is the actual message to de displayed in the transcript.\n",
    "- Use only the values 'Player 1', 'Player 2' or 'GM' for the `from_` and `to` arguments. Messages that the game master emits to itself should have 'GM' both in `from_` and `to`.\n",
    "- All events that involve making an API call should pass an additional `call` argument to `log_event()` containing the actual and exact API input and output objects, for posterior inspection if necessary. The `Player` base class already implements this.\n",
    "- Any other episode-level object needed for scoring or documentation can be logged with `log_key()`.\n",
    "#### Record files\n",
    "Every action that is logged gets saved into the episode's `interactions.json` file after it is played. This file is then used to build game transcripts and to compute evaluation scores. The episode's `requests.json` file contains the API calls, saved when `log_event()` is called with a `call` argument. If you use a list, make deep copies to guarantee that you are not logging an object that mutates.\n",
    "#### Records and scoring\n",
    "The `GameScorer`'s (see [here](#gamescorer-implementation)) `compute_scores()` method gets the `interactions.json` dictionary as argument, so every key and value that is necessary to compute scores should be logged into the interaction file.\n",
    "### IMPORTANT: Inspecting the game records\n",
    "During development, always check the generated `interactions.json` and `requests.json` to make sure that the API calls are passing the correct structure and that the records are being correctly saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "`interactions.json` is built by the game master as a way to represent the actual interaction (with all its meta-events like parsing messages or checking game rules). This is used to create the transcripts, which are a user-friendly visualisation of the interaction. But remember that this does not reflect the actual API calls, this only reflects what the game master makes of the game!\n",
    "\n",
    "[Testing and refinement](#testing-and-refinement) has an example of checking `interactions.json` records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual prompts and responses from the model are saved into `requests.json`, when an action is logged with its corresponding prompt and response object (see below how to do it). This file will reflect what was actually passed to and from the LLM. Remember that LLMs do not keep a internal state, so every call to a model must contain its full dialogue history. Also remember that when there are two LLMs playing at once, each will have its own dialogue history, which may be different! That's why, for debugging purposes, only looking at `interactions.json` is not enough, because it may not reflect exactly what the LLMs consumed and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging framework level events\n",
    "To log framework level events for debugging and benchmarking, the framework standard logger is defined and used: `logger = get_logger(__name__)`. To log these, use `logger.log(<log entry>)`. Everything logged this way is appended to `clembench.log`.\n",
    "### Episode setup\n",
    "The `_on_setup()` method gets all keys=values in the instance dictionary, as we defined above. Use this method to set up everything that is needed so that the game can be played.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to access certain game instance values easily, like the number of turns need to successfully finish a game of `firstlast`. In the template `_on_setup()` method definition, assign the game instance value to `self.n_turns`: `self.n_turns = game_instance['n_turns']`\n",
    "\n",
    "We then instantiate both players (including adding the initial prompts to their message history):\n",
    "Replace\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.some_player = SomeGamePlayer(self.player_models[0])\n",
    "# with\n",
    "self.player_a = Speaker(self.player_models[0], 'A', game_instance['first_letter'])\n",
    "self.player_b = Speaker(self.player_models[1], 'B', game_instance['first_letter'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The two players need to be added to allow iteration. We also pass them their respective initial prompts here:\n",
    "Replace\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.add_player(self.some_player, initial_context=game_instance['initial_prompt'])\n",
    "# with\n",
    "self.add_player(self.player_a, initial_context=game_instance['prompt_player_a'])\n",
    "self.add_player(self.player_b, initial_prompt=game_instance['prompt_player_b'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the first player assignment uses the argument `initial_context`, while the second one uses `initial_prompt` - this is required at player assignment to properly establish the first player's context, otherwise its message history would be incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we assign the `current_turn` attribute, to keep track of the number of turns. (The `DialogueGameMaster` parent class already has the attribute `current_round`, but we want to track individual turns for `firstlast`.) We assign the first letter to the attribute `current_letter` and log it to be accessible for scoring later:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# initialise game variables:\n",
    "self.current_turn: int = 0\n",
    "self.current_letter: str = game_instance['first_letter']\n",
    "# log additional key that will be relevant for evaluation:\n",
    "self.log_key('n_turns', game_instance['n_turns'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of correctness of the latest response (`correct_response`), turn-level success scores (`turn_scores`) and the number of correctly completed turns (`complete_turns`), we assign corresponding attributes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.correct_response = False\n",
    "self.turn_scores = [0] * (self.n_turns + 1)\n",
    "self.complete_turns: int = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we assign attributes to keep track of (in)valid requests (`request_count, parsed_request_count, violated_request_count`) and if the game was aborted or lost:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# initialise common metrics:\n",
    "self.request_count: int = 0\n",
    "self.parsed_request_count: int = 0\n",
    "self.violated_request_count: int = 0\n",

    "# initialise attributes that will be used for the evaluation scores\n",
    "self.aborted: bool = False\n",
    "self.lose: bool = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** These values are mandatory clemcore scores and MUST be implemented and recorded!\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FirstLast` `_on_setup()` method should now look like this:\n",
